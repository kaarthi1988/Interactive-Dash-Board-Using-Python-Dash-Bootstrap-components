## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive examination of the impacts of the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment, the housing market, and economic well-being across California, Florida, New York, and Texas. By analyzing these dimensions, we aim to understand the multifaceted effects of economic downturns on various aspects of socioeconomic stability.

## Dimension and State Selection
Unemployment, the housing market, and economic well-being were chosen as key dimensions for analysis. California, Florida, New York, and Texas were selected for their diverse socioeconomic characteristics, offering unique perspectives on the impacts of economic crises.

## Data Source and Preparation
Data for three dimensionsâ€™ attributes were collected from the following sources:
1. [Federal Reserve Economic Data | FRED | St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
2. [Zillow Research Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data)

The dashboards were generated utilizing Python for backend functionality, HTML for structuring the layout, Dash for creating interactive web applications, Bootstrap components for styling, and Plotly for data visualization within the dashboards.

## Executive Summary

### Unemployment
- Both the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic led to spiked unemployment rates, but recovery trajectories differed significantly.
- New York exhibited higher Job Losers Rate and Unemployed for 15 Weeks compared to the Great Recession during COVID-19, reflecting the distinct impact of the pandemic on certain industries and labor market dynamics.
- California consistently exhibited high unemployment rates across both crises, indicating persistent challenges in its labor market resilience.

### Housing Market
- Prior to the recession, Home Price Index (HPI) peaked in most states except Texas, indicating robust housing market conditions fueled by growing demand and construction activity.
- During the recession, there was a decline in HPI attributed to reduced consumer confidence, tightening credit conditions, and decreased demand.
- Conversely, during the COVID-19 pandemic, HPI exhibited an upward trend, signaling increasing housing prices fueled by factors such as low mortgage rates, shifting housing preferences due to remote work, and limited housing supply.

### Economic Well-being
- Despite challenges posed by recessions and pandemics, there was a discernible increase in Total Personal Income across all states over time, suggesting some resilience in economic activity and income generation.
- Minimum Wage exhibited varied trends across states, with Florida witnessing a more substantial increase during the recession compared to Texas, indicating efforts to address income disparities amidst economic hardships.
- The Civilian Labor Force increased across all states during the COVID-19 period, suggesting resilience and adaptability in the face of economic challenges.

## Leaders
- New York exhibited unique patterns in unemployment and economic well-being, experiencing higher rates of certain unemployment categories during COVID-19 compared to the Great Recession. The state's robust financial sector faced challenges during both crises, contributing to elevated unemployment rates.

## Laggards
- Florida faced significant reductions in housing permits during the recession, reflecting the severity of the housing market downturn. The state's heavy reliance on tourism and real estate made it particularly vulnerable to economic shocks.

## Differential Impacts
- Variations in top-tier home values were observed across states, with Florida experiencing a decline during the recession and relative stability during COVID-19. This reflects unique housing market dynamics influenced by factors such as industry composition, population demographics, and regional economic resilience strategies.
